* Candidate genes discovery through augmented gene co-expression analysis - a skin aging application case
* Keywords : gene co-expression, skin aging, pipeline, biological network, module evaluation, transcriptomics, topology
* With the development of transcriptomics technologies, gene expression analysis has become an important resources in molecular profiling. However most known methods fail to detect more subtle gene sub-systems contributing to phenotypes since they mainly focus on singular gene independently.  
Moving to holistic genome expression study allows both less biased discovery of new associations/biomarkers, and detection of large scale signatures. Using co-expression to define genes interactions, multiple studies have been exploring those systems. Knowledge can be gathered from modules based on topologic intelligence (data-driven) while additional biological information can be added (knowledge-driven) to help interpretation. Current tools to perform such analyses remain accessible only to researchers with advanced bioinformatics skills. Moreover, it requires holding a series of tools, each one of them performing one or few functionalities.  
Our new automated pipeline aims to fulfill those needs: supporting both microarray and RNA-seq data, filtration and normalization, co-expression network building, modules detection, functional enrichment, graph comparison, topological analysis, transcription factor positioning and graph visualisation. Using skin aging samples from two distant age range, we explored the augmented network built by our tool to discover new gene that could complete the knowledge of skin aging process.
